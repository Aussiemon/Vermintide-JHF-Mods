title = "Lorebook Pages Forever";
description = "Lorebook pages are normally hidden after they've all been unlocked. This mod makes pages visible at all times, so that they may be pinged for other players. Pages can still be interacted with, but you'll only get a sense of pride and accomplishment from picking them up.

This mod also contains an option to disable lorebook page drops from sack rats. These pages would normally appear from sack rats even when invisible, taking up drop slots that could be pickups or loot dice.
