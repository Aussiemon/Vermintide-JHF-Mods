title = "Smaller Bright Wizard Staffs";
description = "This mod allows players to scale the first-person models of their Bright Wizard staffs. Sizes range from elaborate toy staff to regular-sized models. By default, veteran staffs are re-sized to be more in-line with other weapons.

The effect is purely client-side, and only affects the appearance of staffs in first-person perspective.
