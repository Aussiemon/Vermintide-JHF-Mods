title = "Extra Potion Dialogue";
description = "If you haven't looked through the game code, you might not know that there are references to early versions of systems now in Vermintide 2. For instance, there are references to 'stances' that players could activate and unlock, that would presumably change your character's skills and stats. There are also references to a 'prestige' system that sounds similar to arena shooter games.

One of these unused features was a series of dialogue events that would play when your character switched from offensive to defensive stances, and vice versa. This mod plays the offensive sound events when drinking a strength potion, and the defensive sound events when drinking a speed potion.

It's a really cool, subtle effect. The voice lines are fitting, and unused elsewhere. Who doesn't like unused voice lines?
