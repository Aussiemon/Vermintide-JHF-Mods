title = "Krench Mutation";
description = "This mod is a toggleable gamemode mutation that replaces rat ogres with Krench the Stormvermin Champion. When active, every time an ogre would normally appear, Krench will arrive instead with his warpstone-infused halberd.

The mod may be activated or deactivated from the VMF mutator screen while choosing a mission.
