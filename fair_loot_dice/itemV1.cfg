title = "Fair Loot Dice";
description = "The first three long Vermintide missions have an average of about 23 chests per map. After those maps, the number of chests drops off severely. The DLC missions have even less. Two loot dice double your chances of getting a 7 on full book nightmare. Because of this, players looking for reds are often stuck on the same missions.

This mod relates probability of loot dice to the number of chests in a map. It can do this by only modifying probability for low chest maps, or by treating all maps as if they had 17 chests to open. Works for the lobby if hosting.
