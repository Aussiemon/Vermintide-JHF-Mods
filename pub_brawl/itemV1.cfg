title = "Enhanced Pub Brawl";
description = "Fatshark occasionally removes Pub Brawl, the drunken fist-fight minigame in the Red Moon Inn. By default, this mod ensures vanilla Pub Brawl is always present in its Vanilla form.

This mod also adds an option for extra goodies in the inn (e.g. potions and bombs).
