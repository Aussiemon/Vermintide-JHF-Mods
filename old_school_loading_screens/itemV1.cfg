title = "Old School Loading Screens";
description = "This mod re-adds early Vermintide 'old school' loading screens that were replaced years ago. The mod also adds unused mission briefs to the level selection map.

Every loading screen is optional, and may be toggled on or off. If you so choose, the game may also randomly choose loading screens from among the 'old school' and vanilla options.
